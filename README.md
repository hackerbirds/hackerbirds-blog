# Shitty blog page maker

Write blog posts quickly using this little script. It is based on [Lichen](https://lichen.sensorstation.co/), and is backwards compatible with Gemtext, with the added bonus of:
- `inline code blocks` in the middle of your text
- *bold* text
- __italic__ text

Write in `post.md` like we just did, then run `python3 build.py`, and the resulting `index.html` is your pretty website

## Disclaimers

### This is not a fully-automated script

You are meant to manually modify the code and resulting HTML to your liking if needed.

### You are all alone in this adventure

We will not maintain this project, it was created for our own personal use. That said, if you think you can use it or modify it for yourself, go ahead.
