# Shitty blog page maker

Write blog posts quickly using this little script. It is based on [Lichen](https://lichen.sensorstation.co/), and is backwards compatible with Gemtext, with the added bonus of:
- `inline code blocks` in the middle of your text
- *bold* text
- __italic__ text

Write in `post.txt` like we just did, then run `python3 build.py`, and the resulting `index.html` is your pretty website

#### *Ok, what else?*
- Quick horizontal bar breaks with "----" at the start of a new line
- Cool looking blocks with "% [text you want]" at the start of a new line

## What? Why?

## Disclaimers

### This is not a fully-automated script

You are meant to manually modify the code and resulting HTML to your liking if needed.

### You are all alone in this adventure

We will not maintain or modify this project for anyone else but us. That said, if you think you can use it or modify it for yourself, go ahead.
