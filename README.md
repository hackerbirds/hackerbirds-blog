# Hackerbirds's static blog page builder

Write blog posts quickly using this little script. Originally based on [Lichen](https://lichen.sensorstation.co/), it is backwards compatible with Gemtext formatting.

## Features

Below are examples for each of the features. 

### You may also check at `post.md` and the resulting html file in `result/index.html` to see how it looks in practice.

#### Inline text formatting
* Bold text: `Wrap the text with a star (*). Example: *this text will be bold*`
* Italic text: `Wrap the text with two underscores (__). Example: __this text will be italic__`
* Strikethrough text: `Wrap the text with two tildes (~~). Example: ~~this text will be strikethoughd~~`

#### Title and headers

* `# Title`
* `## Big header`
* `### Smaller header`

#### Code

* Inline code/monospace font: ````Wrap the text with two ticks (`). Example: `this will be monospace`.````
* Code blocks/monospace blocks:
````
Wrap the text with three ticks *in new lines* to start the code block.
Make sure the lines with the ticks does not contain any text.

Example:

```
this is a code block!
```

````

#### Block quotes
````
To make a block quote, add a new line and start it with "> " (don't forget the space). Anything after will be part of the quote.

> This is a very serious quote.
````

#### URL/Links

````
Links are similar looking to images, so be careful to not confuse between them!

=> https://zombo.com You can do anything at Zombo.com
````

#### Hackerbirds's signature bird dialogue block

````
% If you write a line starting with "%" like this, a little bird will show up next to your gorgeous text.
````

#### Horizontal bar break:
````
To add an horizontal bar to break off your paragraphs,
you can add a line consisting of three consecutive dashes ("---")
Like so:
---
Now, this text is separated and alone.
````

#### Raw HTML Block:

````
<>
<!-- anything between the <> is raw HTML. -->
<p style="color: red;">Hello!</p>
<>
````
