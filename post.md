# Creating blog posts faster with hackerbirds-blog

(To see the text before building, see `post.md`. If you want the compiled HTML, see `result/index.html`.)

Creating paragraphs is easy. Just write as much as you want in one straight line, and to make a new paragraph...

Just add a new line like we just did. If you want to separate your text even more, there's always the horizontal bar:
---
Now your text is extra separate. Awesome.

Each new line (`\n`) is a line break in HTML, so add spaces whenever you feel like it. Here's an extra wide space for your paragraphs:




Wow, silent.

## Headers

# That's big. For the title.
## That's not as big. For main sections.
### That's even smaller. The smallest, actually. For subsections.

## Formatting

You can do a bunch of inline stuff, like *bold*, __italic__, or ~~strikethrough~~ text if that's what you want. __*~~why not all of them at once too?~~*__

Need to use a single \star or \tick in the middle of your text too? Write "\ star" or "\ tick" (without the space): *now\staryou\starcan\starhave\starall\starthe\starstars* 

Like this: \star \tick \star \tick \star

Do you want your text to look monospace? There's the `inline code formatting` for that.

```
Or a whole block,
  if you  need   to   paste

       anything without  formatting.
```

## Links

You can have a link like this:

=> https://hackerbirds.neocities.org/

Or modify the text to your desires:

## Images

To add an image (for accessibility reasons you must add alt text), here's how you do it:

-> ./dinosaurs.jpeg | Photo of adorable dinosaurs

And if you want text under your image, add another parameter like such:

-> ./dinosaurs.jpeg | Photo of adorable dinosaurs | Aren't they cute?

## Lists

Lists automatically start when you add an element and end when you make an empty new line, like this:

* This is an unordered list.
* Unordered means the elements aren't numbered.
* To add elements, just start the line with `"\star "`.

*) This is an *ordered* list.
*) Ordered means the elements are numbered.
*) To add elements, just start the line with `"\star) "`.

% Lucky for us, it's just an `%` away.

## HTML Block

If all of these features aren't enough for you, and you need extra customisation, the HTML block is for you:

<>
<p style="color: blue; background-color: black; padding: 6px;">
Anything between the "<>" will be processed as raw HTML.
</p>
<>

For instance, you could use it for <details> as such:

<>
<details>
<summary>Click here to see more stuff!</summary>
Boop! Hello!
</details>
<>

It is far from perfect but we hope you will find our tool convenient.
